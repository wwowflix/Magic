🔁 THE FULL AUTOMATION \& SELF-HEALING FLOW

🔹 inbox/

🧠 Purpose: Raw intake zone.

🟡 Status: First drop-point for all new .py files (generated, downloaded, copied, or AI-created).

🔍 What happens here:



Power Automate / File Juggler scans for new files.



Based on filename prefix like 03B\_..., the script is routed for review.



🔹 review/

👀 Purpose: Human or AI-assisted quality check.

🟠 Status: Temporary holding zone before approval.

🔍 What happens here:



Files with \_draft.py or not ending in \_READY.py go here.



You (or future automation) can decide: promote to approved/, move to hold/, or send to quarantine/.



🔹 approved/

✅ Purpose: Final staging before it enters the system.

🟢 Status: Only \_READY.py files go here.

🔍 What happens here:



Once marked as approved and READY, run\_sorter.ps1 moves them to:



bash

Copy

Edit

scripts/phaseX/module\_Y/

overwriting any placeholder if needed (with backup).



This is your source of truth for greenlit code.



🔹 hold/

⏸️ Purpose: On-hold or pending decision.

🟡 Status: Maybe good, maybe risky.

🔍 What happens here:



Could be reused later or upgraded to review/ or approved/.



🔹 quarantine/

🚫 Purpose: Unsafe or broken files.

🔴 Status: Blacklist zone.

🔍 What happens here:



Files with syntax errors, unauthorized code, wrong format, etc.



Can be logged or deleted by a future health checker.



🔹 scripts/phaseX/module\_Y/

📦 Purpose: Final canonical home for every .py script.

🟢 Status: Clean, organized, auto-runnable.

🔍 What happens here:



Created using your cleaned CSV.



Placeholder files are initially stored here.



Once approved/ script is moved here, it replaces the placeholder.



🔹 backups/

🛡️ Purpose: Archive of replaced placeholders.

🟣 Status: Auto-created as needed.

🔍 What happens here:



When a real \_READY.py replaces a placeholder, the placeholder is backed up to:



makefile

Copy

Edit

D:\\MAGIC\\backups\\phaseX\\module\_Y\\

🔹 outputs/, logs/, cold\_storage/, etc.

These are support zones:



outputs/: Where scripts might write generated data (e.g., CSVs, plots).



logs/: For execution and error logs.



cold\_storage/: Archive for deprecated or legacy files.



config/: Global settings or environment configs.



tests/: Optional unit test scripts.

💥 Why This Works

✅ Modular → Each script lives in the correct module phase.

✅ Safe → Approvals and logging ensure only clean scripts go live.

✅ Flexible → You can promote, hold, quarantine, or test at any point.

✅ Scalable → This can support 1000s of scripts without chaos.
