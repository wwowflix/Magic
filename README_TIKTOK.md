# ✅ README — MAGIC Project: TikTok Scraper

## 🎯 PURPOSE

This README explains how to scrape trending hashtags and videos from TikTok for the MAGIC project.

Your scraper:

✅ Uses **undetected_chromedriver** and real browser sessions  
✅ Reads TikTok **cookies from JSON** to stay logged in  
✅ Hits TikTok’s **real API** instead of HTML scraping  
✅ Outputs data to:

D:\MAGIC\data\tiktok_trending.csv

... [TRUNCATED FOR BREVITY]

🎉 **Done! You can now scrape TikTok trends anytime.** 🚀
