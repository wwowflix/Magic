It's incredible to listen to.  (Spoilers ahead)  The most chilling part is that both families knew each other and one daughter was basically beloved and accepted by all, while the other had a more complicated relationship with the family who raised her (and in general a less sunny temperament). When all was revealed once they were adults, the more ""popular"" daughter was wholeheartedly embraced by her biological family, while still cherished by her ""adopted"" family, whereas the other daughter felt like she couldn't truly connect with either. It almost seemed like one of the girls now had two loving families in her life while the other had none.",Sounds like a drama shows plot

2025-07-15,technology,Secret changes to major U.S. health datasets raise alarms | A new study reports that more than 100 United States government health datasets were altered this spring without any public notice.,chrisdh79,7514,116,https://www.psypost.org/secret-changes-to-major-u-s-health-datasets-raise-alarms/,,"used to work for hhs, yeah they made us immediately change our database to remove demographic info and it fucking busted our backend system","If the data doesn't support your narrative, simply alter the data.","From the article: A new study in the medical journal [The Lancet](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673625012498) reports that more than 100 United States government health datasets were altered this spring without any public notice. The investigation shows that nearly half of the files examined underwent wording changes while leaving the official change logs blank. The authors warn that hidden edits of this kind can ripple through public health research and erode confidence in federal data.  To reach these findings, the researchers started by downloading the online catalogues—known as harvest sources—that federal agencies maintain under the 2019 Open Government Data Act. They gathered every entry from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Department of Veterans Affairs that showed a modification date between January 20 and March 25, 2025.  After removing duplicates and files that are refreshed at least monthly, the team was left with 232 datasets. For each one, they located an archived copy that pre‑dated the study window, most often through the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine.  They then used the comparison feature in a word‑processing program to highlight every textual difference between the older and newer versions. Only wording was assessed; numeric tables were not rechecked. Finally, the investigators opened the public change log that sits at the bottom of each dataset’s web page to see whether the alteration had been declared.  One example captures how the edits appeared in practice. A file from the Department of Veterans Affairs that tracks the number of veterans using healthcare services in the 2021 fiscal year had sat untouched for more than two years. On March 5, 2025, the column heading “Gender” was replaced with “Sex.” The same swap was made in the dataset’s title and in the short description at the top of the page. The modification date on the site updated to reflect the change, yet the built‑in change log still reads, “No changes have been archived yet.”  Across the full sample, the pattern was strikingly consistent. One hundred fourteen of the 232 datasets—49 percent—contained what the authors judged to be potentially substantive wording changes. Of these, 106 switched the term “gender” to “sex.” Four files replaced the phrase “social determinants of health” with “non‑medical factors,” one exchanged “socio‑economic status” for “socio‑economic characteristics,” and a single clinical trial listing rewrote its title so that “gender diverse” became “include men and women.”"

Not in a world where President Trump threatens to annex Canada, vows to acquire Greenland from Denmark, and announces that foreign officials may be banned from entering the United States if they “demand that American tech platforms adopt global content moderation policies.” > >Ever since Trump retook office in January, in fact, rapid enshittification has become the organizing principle of US statecraft. This time around, Trumpworld understands that—in controlling the infrastructure layer of global finance, technology, and security—it has vast machineries of coercion at its disposal. As Mark Carney, the prime minister of Canada, recently put it, “The United States is beginning to monetize its hegemony.” > >So what is an ally to do? Like the individual consumers who are trapped by Google Search or Facebook as the core product deteriorates, many are still learning just how hard it is to exit the network. And like the countless startups that have attempted to create an alternative to Twitter or Facebook over the years—most now forgotten, a few successful—other allies are now desperately scrambling to figure out how to build a network of their own.  One of the concerning aspects of this shift to a transactional short-term relationship with the global community, friends and foe alike, is that once the world shifts away from the United States as a default (whether with the dollar or financial services or technical infrastructure) and after a likely painful period of adjustment, it's likely that the world will not shift back again and US power and influence in global affairs will be diminished in the long term.","Thanks for sharing our piece, here's some context:   For decades, allies of the United States lived comfortably amid the sprawl of American hegemony. They constructed their financial institutions, communications systems, and national defense on top of infrastructure provided by the US.  And right about now, they’re probably wishing they hadn’t.  Back in 2022, Cory Doctorow [coined](https://www.wired.com/story/tiktok-platforms-cory-doctorow/) the term “enshittification” to describe a cycle that has played out again and again in the online economy. Entrepreneurs start off making high-minded promises to get new users to try their platforms. But once users, vendors, and advertisers have been locked in—by network effects, insurmountable collective action problems, high switching costs—the tactics change. The platform owners start squeezing their users for everything they can get, even as the platform fills with ever more low-quality slop. Then they start squeezing vendors and advertisers too.  For decades, America’s allies accepted US control of these systems, because they believed in the American commitment to a “rules-based international order.” They can’t persuade themselves of that any longer. Not in a world where President Trump threatens to annex Canada, vows to acquire Greenland from Denmark, and [announces](https://www.state.gov/announcement-of-a-visa-restriction-policy-targeting-foreign-nationals-who-censor-americans/) that foreign officials may be banned from entering the United States if they “demand that American tech platforms adopt global content moderation policies.”  Ever since Trump retook office in January, in fact, rapid enshittification has become the organizing principle of US statecraft.

2025-07-15,technology,‘China’s car market has lost all reason’ – the country’s largest western carmaker refuses to compete in Tesla and BYD’s EV price war,SelflessMirror,1021,279,https://fortune.com/2025/07/15/china-car-market-tesla-byd-price-war-volkswagen-audi-jetta/,,"Lots of non-Chinese manufacturers in other industries have given up competing in China because they are unable to turn a profit there. Case in point: solar and wind.  Likewise, India is very difficult for foreign companies to compete in.","Imagine the prices with this level of competition   ""According to Volkswagen Group, there are 130 brands are competing for a share of the EV and plug-in hybrid sales. The result of such an oversaturated supply is that almost no one is able to earn a positive return.""","IMO, western carmakers are too top-heavy, focusing on giving shareholders and CEOs profit rather than reinvesting in the company."

I don't know if that's true but, if it is, that's a pretty fucked up response vs just ban listing that specific cartridge's unique identifiers. Especially because that cartridge still exists and can burn other people down the line. Hell, this guy might not even be the first victim.",The person also admitted to using a mig switch to backup his games.  Can't say for sure if his used copy is the reason for the ban.,"Really doesn't matter what this story is, the fact that people have purchased a product that can be bricked at any time, is a pretty worrying development for consumers, give them an inch and they will take a mile, and they will."

And then they sprinkled on some AI to their product and their forward engineers infected all of our government agencies with their Trump connection.

It's incredibly clear now that social media screws with peoples brains in ways that are profoundly damaging.,This is unlikely to result in a ban but more likely to result in social media companies being forced to do more to police their content and identify their users.   The ban will be held over their heads as a consequence of failing to manage their platforms properly.,"Ban addictive algorithms and UX practices, not social media itself."
