## Budget Tracking and Enforcement

- You can set your maximum allowed API spend (daily or monthly) inside `orchestrator.py`.
- Spend is tracked cumulatively in `budget.json` file.
- When the spend exceeds the limit, orchestrator raises an exception and stops to avoid overspending.
- Run `test_budget.py` with pytest to verify the budget enforcement works correctly.

To reset your budget spend, edit or delete `budget.json`.
